  DIV2K:
    PSNR: 35.00dB
description: "SESR, super-efficient super resolution (formerly known as FSRCNNv5)\
  \ is a network aims to generate a high-resolution image from a low-resolution input.\n\
  Name was changed by ARM developers when they wrote research paper on their technique.\n\
  The attached int8 fully quantized tflite model achieves 35.00dB PSNR on DIV2K dataset.\
  \ \nThe model takes 1080p input (in YCbCr, i.e., takes a 1x1920x1080x1 tensor as\
  \ input) and outputs 4K images (in YCbCr, i.e., 1x3840x2160x1 output).\n Compatability\
  \ note:\n Please note that SESR is a high-end network operating on 1080p->4K images\
  \ and runtime memory use of this network requires an end system with at least 100MB\
  \ of memory available to ensure successful execution.\n We anticipate the network\
  \ being used in premium devices as part of a camera imaging pipeline providing highest\
  \ quality digital zoom.\n\n Submitter:\n chen.hayat@arm.com"
