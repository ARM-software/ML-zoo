description: "Tiny Wav2letter is a tiny version of the original Wav2Letter model.\
  \ It is a convolutional speech recognition neural network. This implementation was\
  \ created by Arm, pruned to 50% sparsity, fine-tuned and quantized using the TensorFlow\
  \ Model Optimization Toolkit.\r\n\r\n"
