description: 'This is a clustered (32 clusters, kmeans++ centroid initialization)
  and retrained (fine-tuned) FP32 version of the DS-CNN Large model developed by Arm
  from the Hello Edge paper. Code for the original DS-CNN implementation can be found
  here: https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-KWS-for-MCU. The original model was converted
  to Keras and optimized using the Clustering API in TensorFlow Model Optimization
  Toolkit.'
