description: 'This is a clustered (32 clusters, kmeans++ centroid initialization) and
  retrained (fine-tuned) FP32 version of the DS-CNN Large model developed by Arm from the Hello Edge paper.
  Code for the original DS-CNN implementation can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-KWS-for-MCU. 
  The original model was converted to Keras and optimized using the Clustering API in TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit.'
