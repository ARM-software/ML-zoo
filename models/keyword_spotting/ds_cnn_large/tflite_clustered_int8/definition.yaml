description: 'This is a clustered (32 clusters, kmeans++ centroid initialization),
  retrained (fine-tuned) and fully quantized version (INT8) of the DS-CNN Large model
  developed by Arm from the Hello Edge paper. Code for the original DS-CNN implementation
  can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-KWS-for-MCU. The original
  model was converted to Keras, optimized using the Clustering API in TensorFlow Model
  Optimization Toolkit, and quantized using post-training quantization in the TF Lite
  Converter.'
