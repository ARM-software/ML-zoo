    top_1_accuracy: 0.94701
description: 'This is a clustered (32 clusters, kmeans++ centroid initialization), retrained (fine-tuned) and fully quantized version (INT8)
  of the DS-CNN Large model developed by Arm from the Hello Edge paper. Code for the original DS-CNN implementation 
  can be found here: https://github.com/ARM-software/ML-KWS-for-MCU. 
  The original model was converted to Keras, optimized using the Clustering API in TensorFlow Model Optimization Toolkit, and quantized using post-training quantization in the TF Lite Converter.'
